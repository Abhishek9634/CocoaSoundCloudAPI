# Your Guide to the SoundCloud API Wrapper

So you want to use SoundCloud in your iOS or OSX Desktop Application? Awesome. This little guide will help you do it.

There's three parts to it:
* How to [integrate the SoundCLoud API Wrapper into your Project](Setup.md)
* How to [use the SoundCloud API Wrapper](Usage.md)
* How to [share your Audio using SoundCloud](Sharing.md)

Afraid of doing the journey alone? Don't be, there's a lot of places where you can find help:
* The SoundCloud API documentation. You'll need this.
* The SoundCloud API Discussion Group

Please keep in mind that all of this is under heavy development, and things might change from time to time. Please update your frameworks often, and keep this space in mind.

Your Friends at SoundCloud.
